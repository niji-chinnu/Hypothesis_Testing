# Hypothesis_Testing
Hypothesis is done based on initial analysis of available data. The goal of a hypothesis is to explain an observation and set the direction for further research. 
Null Hypothesis says “No relationship” while alternate hypothesis “There is a relationship”.
A hypothesis is meant to be proven (or disproven) through experimentation. Hypothesis test evaluates two statements about a population. The statements that are mutually exclusive. The test concludes which statement best reflects the sample data.
Steps to test a hypothesis:
1.Establish hypothesis
2.Set a significance level
3.Find the region of rejection for the null hypothesis
4.Compute p-value
5.Compare p-value to the significance level to retain or reject the null hypothesis
